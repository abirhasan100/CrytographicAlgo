DES is a block cipher; it encrypts data in 64-bit blocks. A 64-bit block of plaintext goes in one end of 
the algorithm and a 64-bit block of ciphertext comes out the other end. DES is a symmetric algorithm: 
The same algorithm and key are used for both encryption and decryption (except for minor 
differences in the key schedule).
