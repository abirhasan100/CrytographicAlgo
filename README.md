# CrytographicAlgo
#What's this?
This is a initiative to :
1. research over all the cryptographics algorithms with there running time (average of encrypting and decrypting time).
2. try Brute Force Attack on them.
3. to find is there backdoor exist. 
4. etc.

#How long?
I have working on cryptographic things for a long time but never gathered my implementation like this. Though i have willing to do so for a long time, but took so long. However i shortlisted some typical (and some rare) cryptographic algorithms but yet i can't estimate how long it will take to to implement (and upload) all those.

So, Let's see what Allah have decided for us :)
